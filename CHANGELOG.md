## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- L1 `always_suspect` patterns are PCRE, matched through an injected
  `ctx.re_find`, so one rule file serves every adapter. Missing matcher
  disables the prefilter with a single warning (fail-open).

### Added
- OpenResty adapter (`adapters/openresty`): `resty.jev.edge` with init /
  init_worker / access / log / config_api / metrics; providers `jev`
  (TypeSafe System One), `openai-compat` and `mock`; shared-dict cache,
  breaker wiring, L3 async timer with IP reputation, `/_jev/config`
  runtime override with validation, `/_jev/metrics` Prometheus text,
  config-file reload timer. 14 Test::Nginx blocks (61 assertions) run in
  the official OpenResty image via `make test-openresty`. File-mtime reload
  is not yet covered by a test.
- M1 core skeleton: `core/` (normalize, rules, judge, policy, breaker, verdict,
  defaults, init) with 68 busted specs; bundled `injection` and `abuse`
  templates; `rules/llm-endpoints.lua` and `rules/default.lua`.
- Design section in `README.md` covering the three-layer filter, provider
  abstraction, cache, breaker, header protocol, hot reload and bench plan.
- Repository scaffolding: license, lint config, changelog.
